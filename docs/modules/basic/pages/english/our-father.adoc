Our Father, +
Who art in Heaven hallowed be Thy name. +
Thy kingdom come; +
Thy will be done on earth, as it is in Heaven. +
Give us this day our daily bread; +
and forgive us our trespasses, +
as we forgive those who trespass against us. +
And lead us not into temptation; +
but deliver us from evil. +

Amen.
