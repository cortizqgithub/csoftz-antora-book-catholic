= Basic Prayer

Prayer changes lives. For the better. Always. There is no greater, no moreeffective way to change our lives and those of others — for the good — than prayer ... praying to God. Prayer is the communication between God and man. We will not know God apart from prayer, this dialogue between God and man, anymore than we will come to know anyone apart from speaking to them and listening to them.
Through prayer alone we come to know God's will for us.
